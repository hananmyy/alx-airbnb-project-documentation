# Data Flow Diagram – Airbnb Clone  

## **Overview**  
The data flow diagram (DFD) illustrates how information moves through the system, covering key interactions such as user registration, property management, bookings, payments, and reviews.  

## **Key Data Flows**  
✔ **User inputs registration details → system validates and stores data**.  
✔ **Guest searches for properties → system retrieves available listings**.  
✔ **Guest books a property → system updates booking status**.  
✔ **Guest completes payment → system records transaction**.  
✔ **User submits a review → system stores feedback for future queries**.
